  abstract = {
    Serverless computing has emerged as a new compelling paradigm for the
    deployment of applications and services. It represents an evolution of cloud programming models,
    abstractions, and platforms, and is a testament to the maturity and wide adoption of cloud technologies.
    In this chapter, we survey existing serverless platforms from industry, academia, and
    open source projects, identify key characteristics and use cases, and describe technical
    challenges and open problems.

  abstract="The adoption of cloud computing facilities and programming models differs vastly between different application domains. Scalable web applications, low-latency mobile backends and on-demand provisioned databases are typical cases for which cloud services on the platform or infrastructure level exist and are convincing when considering technical and economical arguments. Applications with specific processing demands, including high-performance computing, high-throughput computing and certain flavours of scientific computing, have historically required special configurations such as compute- or memory-optimised virtual machine instances. With the rise of function-level compute instances through Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) models, the fitness of generic configurations needs to be re-evaluated for these applications. We analyse several demanding computing tasks with regards to how FaaS models compare against conventional monolithic algorithm execution. Beside the comparison, we contribute a refined FaaSification process for legacy software and provide a roadmap for future work.",
